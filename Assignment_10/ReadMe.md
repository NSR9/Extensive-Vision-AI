# Assignment 10 
## Problem statement:-

1. Assignment A:
    1. Download the TINY IMAGENET dataset. 
    2. Train ResNet18 on this dataset (70/30 split) for 50 Epochs. Target 50%+ Validation Accuracy.
2. Assignment B:
    1. Download the COCO dataset. 
    2. Identify these things for this dataset:
    3. readme data for class distribution (along with the class names) along with a graph 
    4. Calculate the Anchor Boxes for k = 3, 4, 5, 6 and draw them.
    5. Share the calculations for both via a notebook uploaded on your GitHub Repo
